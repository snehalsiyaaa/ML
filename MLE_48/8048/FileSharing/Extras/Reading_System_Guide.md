# Personal Reading & Knowledge System Setup Guide
## Zotero + Obsidian + ZotLit

A staged workflow for building your reading history and linking ideas



## **Overview**

This guide walks you through:
1. Building the full Zotero + Obsidian setup
2. Adding 1–2 files to learn the workflow
3. Using that workflow to capture, annotate, link, and recall everything you read
4. Later expanding into tagging, templates, and knowledge structures

This system is designed for readers, not just academic writers.
Its goal is to give you a memory, context, and connections across everything you consume.


## 1. Install the Tools
### 1.1 Install Zotero

Zotero is your reading inbox and library.
- Download Zotero for your OS.
- Install normally.

### 1.2 Install Zotero Connector

This is the browser extension that allows one-click saving of:
- articles
- PDFs
- websites
- blog posts
- book pages
- anything with a URL

Install in the browser you use most.

### 1.3 Install Obsidian

Obsidian is your thinking tool, notes space, and linking environment.

Steps:
1. Download Obsidian
2. Create a new vault (folder)
   - Suggested names: `Reading Vault`, `Second Brain`, `Knowledge Base`

### 1.4 Install the Obsidian Plugin: ZotLit

ZotLit connects Zotero and Obsidian.

Inside Obsidian:

Settings → Community Plugins → Turn off Safe Mode

Browse → Search “ZotLit” → Install → Enable

ZotLit enables:

creating literature notes from Zotero items

importing your PDF highlights

linking notes inside your vault

building a reading history

1.5 (Optional) Install Better BibTeX for Zotero

This improves metadata consistency and is standard for researchers.

If installed later, it will not break anything.

1. Test the Setup With 1–2 Files

Once your tools are installed, do this:

2.1 Add File #1 — A Website

Go to any article you like online.
Click the Zotero Connector icon.
Choose the Zotero folder you want it saved into.

Zotero will store:

the link

metadata

snapshot (if enabled)

This is your first reading entry.

2.2 Add File #2 — A PDF

Find any PDF (a report, paper, ebook chapter).

Drag it into Zotero
OR
Open it in your browser and click “Save to Zotero”.

Zotero will:

store the PDF

fetch title/author metadata

allow you to annotate it with highlights

3. Learn the Workflow (Very Important Stage)

This part shows you the rhythm of your reading system.

3.1 Capture the item in Zotero

Everything starts in Zotero:

PDFs

articles

web pages

book chapters

Label it with:

Tags: read, to-read, finished, important

Collections: broad topics (e.g., “Psychology”, “AI”, “Tech”, “Philosophy”)

This builds your reading history.

3.2 Annotate (optional but powerful)

If it’s a PDF:

open inside Zotero

highlight sections

add comments

These can be exported to Obsidian later.

3.3 Send it to Obsidian

Right-click the item in Zotero → “Send to Obsidian” (ZotLit provides the command).
OR
Use ZotLit’s command palette in Obsidian:
ZotLit: Create Literature Note

This generates a Markdown note containing:

title

authors

year

reference ID

your highlights

your comments

a structure where you add a summary and thoughts

This becomes part of your knowledge graph.

3.4 Link it to other notes

Inside Obsidian, open your new literature note.

Start linking concepts using [[double brackets]].
Examples:

[[Cognitive Biases]]

[[Machine Learning]]

[[Economics]]

[[Quotes]]

any idea you want to remember

Over time, this builds a web of ideas — a personal map of your mind.

4. What You Will Have After Using This Once

After adding just two files, you will experience:

A full reading history

A record of your highlights and insights

A working pipeline from reading → thinking

Notes that connect to each other

A lightweight second brain that grows naturally

This is enough to understand the whole system.

5. After You Learn the Flow — Next Steps

Later, after you've practiced:

5.1 Build a Tagging System

Examples:

Topic tags: #ai, #philosophy, #economics

Status: #to-read, #reading, #finished

Priority: #important

We will tailor these to your reading habits.

5.2 Build Smart Templates

We can create templates for:

literature notes

reading summaries

permanent knowledge notes

topic pages (indexes)

All in Markdown.

5.3 Build Connection Maps

You will learn to create:

index notes

hub pages

maps of content

topic clusters

These turn your reading into a living knowledge graph.

6. Summary

You now have a full plan to:

Install the essential tools

Add 1–2 files

Learn the workflow

Expand into tagging, templates, and knowledge linking

This system works for:

casual reading

research

learning new domains

long-term memory

idea development
